# React

## Basics

**Creating a component**

```javascript
function App() {
  //NOTE: first letter should be capital can use this compnent as <App />
  // must return one block of jsx(ext. of js allows to embed js,css,react comps. in html)
    return <h1>Hello World<h1>;
}
```

**Can use js inside using {}**

## Props (READ ONLY)

**Props are used to pass data from parent component to child component**

## State (Internal Data)

Can be updated by components logic
